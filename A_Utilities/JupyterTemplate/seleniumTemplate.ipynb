      "The Cash Flow Statement begins with Net Income, adjusts for non-cash expenses and working capital changes, and then lists cash flow from investing and financing activities; at the end you see the company's net change in cash.\n",

      "Income Statement: Revenue; Cost of Goods Sold; SG&A (Selling, General &\n",

      "Question:  Let's say Apple is buying $100 worth of new iPod factories with debt. How are all 3 statements affected at the start of \"Year 1,\" before anything else happens?\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's go out 1 year, to the start of Year 2. Assume the debt is high-yield so no principal is paid off, and assume an interest rate of 10%. Also assume the factories depreciate at a rate of 10% per year. What happens?\n",
      "\n",
      "At the start of Year 3, the factories all break down and the value of the equipment is written down to $0. The loan must also be paid back now. Walk me through the 3 statements.\n",
      "Answer: On the Cash Flow Statement, the additional investment in factories would show up under Cash Flow from Investing as a net reduction in Cash Flow (so Cash Flow is down by $100 so far). And the additional $100 worth of debt raised would show up as an addition to Cash Flow, canceling out the investment activity. So the cash number stays the same.\n",
      "On the Balance Sheet, there is now an additional $100 worth of factories in the Plants, Property & Equipment line, so PP&E is up by $100 and Assets is therefore up by $100. On the other side, debt is up by $100 as well and so both sides balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a year has passed, Apple must pay interest expense and must record the depreciation.\n",
      "Operating Income would decrease by $10 due to the 10% depreciation charge each year, and the $10 in additional Interest Expense would decrease the Pre-Tax Income by $20 altogether ($10 from the depreciation and $10 from Interest Expense).\n",
      "Assuming a tax rate of 40%, Net Income would fall by $12.\n",
      "On the Cash Flow Statement, Net Income at the top is down by $12. Depreciation is a non-cash expense, so you add it back and the end result is that Cash Flow from Operations is down by $2.\n",
      "That's the only change on the Cash Flow Statement, so overall Cash is down by $2.\n",
      "On the Balance Sheet, under Assets, Cash is down by $2 and PP&E is down by $10 due to the depreciation, so overall Assets are down by $12.\n",
      "On the other side, since Net Income was down by $12, Shareholders' Equity is also down by $12 and both sides balance.\n",
      "Remember, the debt number under Liabilities does not change since we've assumed none of the debt is actually paid back.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 2 years, the value of the factories is now $80 if we go with the 10% depreciation per year assumption. It is this $80 that we will write down in the 3 statements.\n",
      "First, on the Income Statement, the $80 write-down shows up in the Pre-Tax Income line. With a 40% tax rate, Net Income declines by $48.\n",
      "On the Cash Flow Statement, Net Income is down by $48 but the write-down is a non- cash expense, so we add it back - and therefore Cash Flow from Operations increases by $32.\n",
      "There are no changes under Cash Flow from Investing, but under Cash Flow from Financing there is a $100 charge for the loan payback - so Cash Flow from Investing falls by $100.\n",
      "Overall, the Net Change in Cash falls by $68.\n",
      "On the Balance Sheet, Cash is now down by $68 and PP&E is down by $80, so Assets have decreased by $148 altogether.\n",
      "On the other side, Debt is down $100 since it was paid off, and since Net Income was down by $48, Shareholders' Equity is down by $48 as well. Altogether, Liabilities & Shareholders' Equity are down by $148 and both sides balance.\n",

      "Question:  Now let's look at a different scenario and assume Apple is ordering $10 of additional iPod inventory, using cash on hand. They order the inventory, but they have not manufactured or sold anything yet - what happens to the 3 statements?\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's say they sell the iPods for revenue of $20, at a cost of $10. Walk me through the 3 statements under this scenario.\n",
      "Answer: No changes to the Income Statement.\n",
      "Cash Flow Statement - Inventory is up by $10, so Cash Flow from Operations decreases by $10. There are no further changes, so overall Cash is down by $10.\n",

      "Question:  Could you ever end up with negative shareholders' equity? What does it mean?\n",
      "Answer: This goes back to the equation: Old SE + Net Inc. - Dividends so more dividends or negative NE...\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. It is common to see this in 2 scenarios:\n",
      "1. Leveraged Buyouts with dividend recapitalizations - it means that the owner of the company has taken out a large portion of its equity (usually in the form of cash), which can sometimes turn the number negative.\n",
      "2. It can also happen if the company has been losing money consistently and therefore has a declining Retained Earnings balance, which is a portion of Shareholders' Equity.\n",
      "It doesn't \"mean\" anything in particular, but it can be a cause for concern and possibly demonstrate that the company is struggling (in the second scenario).\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What is working capital? How is it used?\n",
      "Answer: Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities.\n",
      "If it's positive, it means a company can pay off its short-term liabilities with its short- term assets. It is often presented as a financial metric and its magnitude and sign (negative or positive) tells you whether or not the company is \"sound.\"\n",
      "Bankers look at Operating Working Capital more commonly in model.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What is Operating Working Capital?\n",
      "Answer: (Current Assets - Cash & Cash Equivalents) - (Current Liabilities - Debt)\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What does negative Working Capital mean? Is that a bad sign?\n",
      "Answer: Not necessarily. It depends on the type of company and the specific situation - here are a few different things it could mean:\n",
      "1. High deferred revenue: Some companies with subscriptions or longer-term contracts often have negative Working Capital because of high Deferred Revenue balances.\n",
      "2. Retail and restaurant companies like Amazon, Wal-Mart, and McDonald's often have negative Working Capital because customers pay upfront - so they can use the cash generated to pay off their Accounts Payable rather than keeping a large cash balance on-hand. This can be a sign of business efficiency.\n",
      "3. In other cases, negative Working Capital could point to financial trouble or possible bankruptcy (for example, when customers don't pay quickly and upfront and the company is carrying a high debt balance).\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Recently, banks have been writing down their assets and taking huge quarterly losses. Walk me through what happens on the 3 statements when there's a write-down of $100.\n",
      "Answer: First, on the Income Statement, the $100 write-down shows up in the Pre-Tax Income line. With a 40% tax rate, Net Income declines by $60.\n",
      "On the Cash Flow Statement, Net Income is down by $60 but the write-down is a non- cash expense, so we add it back - and therefore Cash Flow from Operations increases by $40.\n",
      "Overall, the Net Change in Cash rises by $40.\n",
      "On the Balance Sheet, Cash is now up by $40 and an asset is down by $100 (it's not clear which asset since the question never stated the specific asset to write-down). Overall, the Assets side is down by $60.\n",
      "On the other side, since Net Income was down by $60, Shareholders' Equity is also down by $60 - and both sides balance.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Walk me through a $100 \"bailout\" of a company and how it affects the 3 statements.\n",
      "Answer: First, confirm what type of \"bailout\" this is - Debt? Equity? A combination? The most common scenario here is an equity investment from the government, so here's what happens:\n",
      "No changes to the Income Statement. On the Cash Flow Statement, Cash Flow from Financing goes up by $100 to reflect the government's investment, so the Net Change in Cash is up by $100.\n",
      "On the Balance Sheet, Cash is up by $100 so Assets are up by $100; on the other side, Shareholders' Equity would go up by $100 to make it balance.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Walk me through a $100 write-down of debt - as in OWED debt, a liability - on a company's balance sheet and how it affects the 3 statements.\n",
      "Answer: This is counter-intuitive. When a liability is written down you record it as a gain on the Income Statement (with an asset write-down, it's a loss) - so Pre-Tax Income goes up by $100 due to this write-down. Assuming a 40% tax rate, Net Income is up by $60.\n",
      "On the Cash Flow Statement, Net Income is up by $60, but we need to subtract that debt write-down - so Cash Flow from Operations is down by $40, and Net Change in Cash is down by $40.\n",
      "On the Balance Sheet, Cash is down by $40 so Assets are down by $40. On the other side, Debt is down by $100 but Shareholders' Equity is up by $60 because the Net Income was up by $60 - so Liabilities & Shareholders' Equity is down by $40 and it balances.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  When would a company collect cash from a customer and not record it as revenue?\n",
      "Answer: Three examples come to mind:\n",
      "1. Web-based subscription software\n",
      "2. Cell phone carriers that cell annual contracts\n",
      "3. Magazine publishers that sell subscriptions\n",
      "Companies that agree to services in the future often collect cash upfront to ensure stable revenue - this makes investors happy as well since they can better predict a company's performance.\n",
      "Per the rules of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), you only record revenue when you actually perform the services - so the company would not record everything as revenue right away.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  If cash collected is not recorded as revenue, what happens to it?\n",
      "Answer: Usually it goes into the Deferred Revenue balance on the Balance Sheet under Liabilities.\n",
      "Over time, as the services are performed, the Deferred Revenue balance \"turns into\" real revenue on the Income Statement.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What's the difference between accounts receivable and deferred revenue?\n",
      "Answer: Accounts receivable has not yet been collected in cash from customers, whereas deferred revenue has been. Accounts receivable represents how much revenue the company is waiting on, whereas deferred revenue represents how much it is waiting to record as revenue.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How long does it usually take for a company to collect its accounts receivable balance?\n",
      "Answer: Generally the accounts receivable days are in the 40-50 day range, though it's higher for companies selling high-end items and it might be lower for smaller, lower transaction- value companies.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What's the difference between cash-based and accrual accounting?\n",
      "Answer: Cash-based accounting recognizes revenue and expenses when cash is actually received or paid out; accrual accounting recognizes revenue when collection is reasonably certain (i.e. after a customer has ordered the product) and recognizes expenses when they are incurred rather than when they are paid out in cash.\n",
      "Most large companies use accrual accounting because paying with credit cards and lines of credit is so prevalent these days; very small businesses may use cash-based accounting to simplify their financial statements.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Let's say a customer pays for a TV with a credit card. What would this look like under cash-based vs. accrual accounting?\n",
      "Answer: In cash-based accounting, the revenue would not show up until the company charges the customer's credit card, receives authorization, and deposits the funds in its bank account - at which point it would show up as both Revenue on the Income Statement and Cash on the Balance Sheet.\n",
      "In accrual accounting, it would show up as Revenue right away but instead of appearing in Cash on the Balance Sheet, it would go into Accounts Receivable at first. Then, once the cash is actually deposited in the company's bank account, it would \"turn into\" Cash.\n",

      "Question:  How do you decide when to capitalize rather than expense a purchase?\n",
      "Answer: If the asset has a useful life of over 1 year, it is capitalized (put on the Balance Sheet rather than shown as an expense on the Income Statement). Then it is depreciated (tangible assets) or amortized (intangible assets) over a certain number of years.\n",
      "Purchases like factories, equipment and land all last longer than a year and therefore show up on the Balance Sheet. Employee salaries and the cost of manufacturing products (COGS) only cover a short period of operations and therefore show up on the Income Statement as normal expenses instead.\n",

      "Question:  Why do companies report both GAAP and non-GAAP (or \"Pro Forma\") earnings?\n",
      "Answer: These days, many companies have \"non-cash\" charges such as Amortization of Intangibles, Stock-Based Compensation, and Deferred Revenue Write-down in their Income Statements. As a result, some argue that Income Statements under GAAP no longer reflect how profitable most companies truly are. Non-GAAP earnings are almost always higher because these expenses are excluded.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  A company has had positive EBITDA for the past 10 years, but it recently went bankrupt. How could this happen?\n",
      "Answer: Several possibilities:\n",
      "1. The company is spending too much on Capital Expenditures - these are not reflected at all in EBITDA, but it could still be cash-flow negative.\n",
      "2. The company has high interest expense and is no longer able to afford its debt.\n",
      "3. The company's debt all matures on one date and it is unable to refinance it due to\n",
      "a \"credit crunch\" - and it runs out of cash completely when paying back the debt.\n",
      "4. It has significant one-time charges (from litigation, for example) and those are\n",
      "high enough to bankrupt the company.\n",
      "Remember, EBITDA excludes investment in (and depreciation of) long-term assets, interest and one-time charges - and all of these could end up bankrupting the company.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Normally Goodwill remains constant on the Balance Sheet - why would it be impaired and what does Goodwill Impairment mean?\n",
      "Answer: Usually this happens when a company has been acquired and the acquirer re-assesses its intangible assets (such as customers, brand, and intellectual property) and finds that they are worth significantly less than they originally thought.\n",
      "It often happens in acquisitions where the buyer \"overpaid\" for the seller and can result in a large net loss on the Income Statement (see: eBay/Skype).\n",
      "It can also happen when a company discontinues part of its operations and must impair the associated goodwill.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Under what circumstances would Goodwill increase?\n",
      "Answer: Technically Goodwill can increase if the company re-assesses its value and finds that it is worth more, but that is rare. What usually happens is 1 of 2 scenarios:\n",
      "1. The company gets acquired or bought out and Goodwill changes as a result, since it's an accounting \"plug\" for the purchase price in an acquisition.\n",
      "2. The company acquires another company and pays more than what its assets are worth - this is then reflected in the Goodwill number.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How is GAAP accounting different from tax accounting?\n",
      "Answer: 1. GAAP is accrual-based but tax is cash-based.\n",
      "2. GAAP uses straight-line depreciation or a few other methods whereas tax\n",
      "accounting is different (accelerated depreciation).\n",
      "3. GAAP is more complex and more accurately tracks assets/liabilities whereas tax\n",
      "accounting is only concerned with revenue/expenses in the current period and what income tax you owe.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What are deferred tax assets/liabilities and how do they arise?\n",
      "Answer: They arise because of temporary differences between what a company can deduct for cash tax purposes vs. what they can deduct for book tax purposes.\n",
      "Deferred Tax Liabilities arise when you have a tax expense on the Income Statement but haven't actually paid that tax in cold, hard cash yet; Deferred Tax Assets arise when you pay taxes in cash but haven't expensed them on the Income Statement yet.\n",
      "The most common way they occur is with asset write-ups and write-downs in M&A deals - an asset write-up will produce a deferred tax liability while a write-down will produce a deferred tax asset (see the Merger Model section for more on this).\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Walk me through how you create a revenue model for a company.\n",
      "Answer: There are 2 ways you could do this: a bottoms-up build and a tops-down build.\n",
      "• Bottoms-Up: Start with individual products / customers, estimate the average sale value or customer value, and then the growth rate in sales and sale values to tie everything together.\n",
      "• Tops-Down: Start with \"big-picture\" metrics like overall market size, then estimate the company's market share and how that will change in coming years, and multiply to get to their revenue.\n",
      "Of these two methods, bottoms-up is more common and is taken more seriously because estimating \"big-picture\" numbers is almost impossible.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Walk me through how you create an expense model for a company.\n",
      "Answer: To do a true bottoms-up build, you start with each different department of a company, the # of employees in each, the average salary, bonuses, and benefits, and then make assumptions on those going forward.\n",
      "Usually you assume that the number of employees is tied to revenue, and then you assume growth rates for salary, bonuses, benefits, and other metrics.\n",
      "Cost of Goods Sold should be tied directly to Revenue and each \"unit\" produced should incur an expense.\n",
      "Other items such as rent, Capital Expenditures, and miscellaneous expenses are either linked to the company's internal plans for building expansion plans (if they have them), or to Revenue for a more simple model.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Let's say we're trying to create these models but don't have enough information or the company doesn't tell us enough in its filings - what do we do?\n",
      "Answer: Use estimates. For the revenue if you don't have enough information to look at separate product lines or divisions of the company, you can just assume a simple growth rate into future years.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the expenses, if you don't have employee-level information then you can just assume that major expenses like SG&A are a percent of revenue and carry that assumption forward.\n",

      "Question:  Walk me through the major items in Shareholders' Equity.\n",
      "Answer: Common items include:\n",
      "• Common Stock - Simply the par value of however much stock the company has issued.\n",
      "• Retained Earnings - How much of the company's Net Income it has \"saved up\" over time.\n",
      "• Additional Paid in Capital - This keeps track of how much stock-based compensation has been issued and how much new stock employees exercising options have created. It also includes how much over par value a company raises in an IPO or other equity offering.\n",
      "• Treasury Stock - The dollar amount of shares that the company has bought back.\n",
      "• Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income - This is a \"catch-all\" that includes\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Walk me through what flows into Retained Earnings.\n",
      "Answer: Retained Earnings = Old Retained Earnings Balance + Net Income - Dividends Issued\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Walk me through what flows into Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC).\n",
      "Answer: APIC = Old APIC + Stock-Based Compensation + Stock Created by Option Exercises\n",

      "Question:  What is the Statement of Shareholders' Equity and why do we use it?\n",
      "Answer: Common items include:\n",
      "• Common Stock - the par value of stock the company has issued.\n",
      "• Retained Earnings - \"Accumulation of net income\"\n",
      "• Additional Paid in Capital - How much stock-based compensation has been issued, effect of employees exercising options have created, if IPO raises over par value or other equity offering.\n",
      "• Treasury Stock - notional value of shares that company has bought back.\n",

      "Answer: Normally you make very simple assumptions here and assume these are percentages of revenue, operating expenses, or cost of goods sold. Examples:\n",
      "• Accounts Receivable: % of revenue.\n",
      "• Deferred Revenue: % of revenue.\n",
      "• Accounts Payable: % of COGS.\n",
      "• Accrued Expenses: % of operating expenses or SG&A.\n",

      "Question:  How should you project Depreciation & Capital Expenditures?\n",
      "Answer: The simple way: project each one as a % of revenue or previous PP&E balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more complex way: create a PP&E schedule that splits out different assets by their useful lives, assumes straight-line depreciation over each asset's useful life, and then assumes capital expenditures based on what the company has invested historically.\n",

      "Question:  How do Net Operating Losses (NOLs) affect a company's 3 statements?\n",
      "Answer: Create a book vs. cash tax schedule where you calculate the Taxable Income based on NOLs, and then look at what you would pay in taxes without the NOLs. Then you book the difference as an increase to the Deferred Tax Asset or DTA on the Balance Sheet.\n",
      "This method reflects the fact that you're saving on cash flow - since the DTA, a liability, is rising - but correctly separates the NOL impact into book vs. cash taxes\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What's the difference between capital leases and operating leases?\n",
      "Answer: Operating leases are used for short-term leasing of equipment and property, and do not involve ownership of anything. Operating lease expenses show up as operating expenses on the Income Statement.\n",
      "Capital leases are used for longer-term items and give the lessee ownership rights; they depreciate and incur interest payments, and are counted as debt.\n",
      "A lease is a capital lease if any one of the following 4 conditions is true:\n",
      "1. If there's a transfer of ownership at the end of the term.\n",
      "2. If there's an option to purchase the asset at a bargain price at the end of the term.\n",
      "3. If the term of the lease is greater than 75% of the useful life of the asset.\n",
      "4. If the present value of the lease payments is greater than 90% of the asset's fair\n",
      "market value.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why would the Depreciation & Amortization number on the Income Statement be different from what's on the Cash Flow Statement?\n",
      "Answer: This happens if D&A is embedded in other Income Statement line items. When this happens, you need to use the Cash Flow Statement number to arrive at EBITDA because otherwise you're undercounting D&A.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why do we look at both Enterprise Value and Equity Value?\n",
      "Answer: Enterprise Value represents the value of the company that is attributable to all investors; Equity Value only represents the portion available to shareholders (equity investors). You look at both because Equity Value is the number the public-at-large sees, while Enterprise Value represents its true value.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  When looking at an acquisition of a company, do you pay more attention to Enterprise or Equity Value?\n",
      "Answer: Enterprise Value, because that's closer to how much an acquirer really \"pays\" and includes the often mandatory debt repayment.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What's the formula for Enterprise Value?\n",
      "Answer: The general formula is:\n",
      "\n",
      "EV = Equity Value + Debt + Preferred Stock + Minority Interest - Cash\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why do you need to add Minority Interest to Enterprise Value?\n",
      "Answer: Whenever a company owns over 50% of another company, it is required to report the financial performance of the other company as part of its own performance.\n",
      "So even though it doesn't own 100%, it reports 100% of the majority-owned subsidiary's financial performance.\n",
      "In keeping with the \"apples-to-apples\" theme, you must add Minority Interest to get to Enterprise Value so that your numerator and denominator both reflect 100% of the majority-owned subsidiary for valuation ratios and multiples such as EV / EBITDA.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you calculate fully diluted shares?\n",
      "Answer: Take the basic share count and add in the dilutive effect of stock options and any other dilutive securities, such as warrants, convertible debt or convertible preferred stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "To calculate the dilutive effects of options, for example, you can use the Treasury Stock method.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Let's say a company has 100 shares outstanding, at a share price of $10 each. It also has 10 options outstanding at an exercise price of $15 each - what is its fully diluted equity value?\n",
      "Answer: $1,000. In this case the options' exercise price is above the current share price, so they have no dilutive effect.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why do you subtract cash in the formula for Enterprise Value? Is that always accurate?\n",
      "Answer: Cash is subtracted because:\n",
      "1. It's considered a non-operating asset\n",
      "2. Equity Value implicitly accounts for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an acquisition, the buyer would will typically \"get\" the cash of the seller, so it effectively pays less for the company based on how large its cash balance is.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Is it always accurate to add Debt to Equity Value when calculating Enterprise Value?\n",
      "Answer: In most cases, yes, because the terms of a debt agreement usually say that debt must be refinanced in an acquisition. And in most cases a buyer will pay off a seller's debt, so it is accurate to say that any debt \"adds\" to the purchase price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only rarely, the buyer may not pay off the debt.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Could a company have a negative Enterprise Value? What would that mean?\n",
      "Answer: Yes. It means that the company has an extremely large cash balance, or an extremely low market capitalization (or both). You see it with:\n",
      "1. Companies on the brink of bankruptcy.\n",
      "2. Financial institutions, such as banks, that have large cash balances.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Could a company have a negative Equity Value? What would that mean?\n",
      "Answer: No. You cannot have a negative share count or a negative share price.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why do we add Preferred Stock to get to Enterprise Value?\n",
      "Answer: Preferred Stock pays out a fixed dividend, and preferred stock holders also have a higher claim to a company's assets than equity investors do. As a result, it is seen as more similar to debt than common stock.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you account for convertible bonds in the Enterprise Value formula?\n",
      "Answer: If the convertible bonds are in-the-money, meaning that the conversion price of the bonds is below the current share price, then you count them as additional dilution to the Equity Value; if they're out-of-the-money then you count the face value of the convertibles as part of the company's Debt.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  A company has 1 million shares outstanding at a value of $100 per share. It also has $10 million of convertible bonds, with par value of $1,000 and a conversion price of $50. How do I calculate diluted shares outstanding?\n",
      "Answer: 1. Make sure \"in-the-money\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Get number individual bonds: divide the value of the convertible bonds - $10 million - by the par value - $1,000 - to figure out how many individual bonds we get:\n",
      "$10 million / $1,000 = 10,000 convertible bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Get the number of shares per bond (the par value divided by the conversion price):\n",
      "$1,000 / $50 = 20 shares per bond.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Multiply # bonds by shares per bond: (20 * 10,000 = 200,000) giving us 1.2 million diluted shares outstanding.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What's the difference between Equity Value and Shareholders' Equity?\n",
      "Answer: Equity Value is the market value and Shareholders' Equity is the book value.\n",
      "\n",
      "For healthy companies, Equity Value usually far exceeds Shareholders' Equity.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Are there any problems with the Enterprise Value formula you just gave me?\n",
      "Answer: Yes - it's too simple. There are lots of other things you need to add into the formula with real companies:\n",
      "• Net Operating Losses - Should be valued and arguably added in, similar to cash.\n",
      "• Long-Term (Bond) and Equity Investments - These should be counted, similar to cash.\n",
      "• Capital Leases - Like debt, these have interest payments - so they should be\n",
      "added in like debt.\n",
      "• (Some) Operating Leases - Sometimes you need to convert operating leases to\n",
      "capital leases and add them as well.\n",
      "• Pension Obligations - Sometimes these are counted as debt as well.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Should you use the book value or market value of each item when calculating Enterprise Value?\n",
      "Answer: Technically, you should use market value for everything. In practice, however, you usually use market value only for the Equity Value portion, because it's almost impossible to establish market values for the rest of the items in the formula - so you just take the numbers from the company's Balance Sheet.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What percentage dilution in Equity Value is \"too high?\"\n",
      "Answer: There's no strict \"rule\" here but most bankers would say that anything over 10% is odd. If your basic Equity Value is $100 million and the diluted Equity Value is $115 million, you might want to check your calculations - it's not necessarily wrong, but over 10% dilution is unusual for most companies.\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Rank the 3 valuation methodologies from highest to lowest expected value.\n",
      "Answer: There is no ranking that always holds. In general, Precedent Transactions will be higher than Comparable Companies due to the Control Premium built into acquisitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond that, a DCF could go either way and it's best to say that it's more variable than other methodologies. Often it produces the highest value, but it can produce the lowest value as well depending on your assumptions.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  When would you not use a DCF in a Valuation?\n",
      "Answer: There are two main reasons you do not use a DCF:\n",
      "1. if the company has unstable or unpredictable cash flows (tech or bio-tech startup)\n",
      "2. When debt and working capital serve a fundamentally different role. For example, banks and financial institutions do not re-invest debt, and working capital is a huge part of their Balance Sheets - so you wouldn't use a DCF for such companies.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What other Valuation methodologies are there?\n",
      "Answer: • LBO Analysis - Determining how much a PE firm could pay for a company to hit a \"target\" IRR, usually in the 20-25% range\n",
      "• Sum of the Parts - Valuing each division of a company separately and adding them together at the end\n",
      "• Liquidation Valuation - Valuing a company's assets, assuming they are sold off and then subtracting liabilities to determine how much capital, if any, equity investors receive\n",
      "• Discount Dividend Model\n",
      "• Future Share Price Analysis - Projecting a company's share price based on the P / E multiples of the public company comparables, then discounting it back to its present value\n",
      "• Replacement Value - Valuing a company based on the cost of replacing its assets\n",
      "• M&A Premiums Analysis - Analyzing M&A deals and figuring out the premium that each buyer paid, and using this to establish what your company is worth\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  When would you use a Liquidation Valuation?\n",
      "Answer: This is most common in bankruptcy scenarios and is used to see whether equity shareholders will receive any capital after the company's debts have been paid off. It is often used to advise struggling businesses on whether it's better to sell off assets separately or to try and sell the entire company.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  When would you use Sum of the Parts?\n",
      "Answer: This is most often used when a company has completely different, unrelated divisions - a conglomerate like General Electric, for example.\n",
      "If you have a plastics division, a TV and entertainment division, an energy division, a consumer financing division and a technology division, you should not use the same set of Comparable Companies and Precedent Transactions for the entire company.\n",
      "Instead, you should use different sets for each division, value each one separately, and then add them together to get the Combined Value.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  When do you use an LBO Analysis as part of your Valuation?\n",
      "Answer: Obviously, you use this whenever you're looking at a Leveraged Buyout - but it is also used to establish how much a private equity firm could pay, which is usually lower than what companies will pay.\n",
      "It is often used to set a \"floor\" on a possible Valuation for the company you're looking at.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What are the most common multiples used in Valuation?\n",
      "Answer: - EV/Revenue\n",

      "Question:  When you're looking at an industry-specific multiple like EV / Scientists or EV / Subscribers, why do you use Enterprise Value rather than Equity Value?\n",
      "Answer: You use Enterprise Value because the inputs from those scientists or subscribers are \"available\" to all the investors (both debt and equity) in a company.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Would an LBO or DCF give a higher valuation?\n",
      "Answer: Technically it could go either way, but in most cases the LBO will give you a lower valuation.\n",
      "Here's the easiest way to think about it: with an LBO, you do not get any value from the cash flows of a company in between Year 1 and the final year - you're only valuing it based on its terminal value.\n",
      "With a DCF, by contrast, you're taking into account both the company's cash flows in between and its terminal value, so values tend to be higher.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How would you present these Valuation methodologies to a company or its investors?\n",
      "Answer: Usually you use a \"football field\" chart where you list each methodology and show the valuation range implied by it .\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How would you value an apple tree?\n",
      "Answer: The same way you would value a company by looking at:\n",

      "Equity Value / EBITDA, however, is comparing apples to oranges because Equity Value does not reflect the company's entire capital structure - only the part available to equity investors.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  When would a Liquidation Valuation produce the highest value?\n",
      "Answer: This is highly unusual, but it could happen if a company had substantial hard assets but the market was severely undervaluing it for a specific reason (such as an earnings miss or cyclicality).\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, the company's Comparable Companies and Precedent Transactions would likely produce lower values as well - and if its assets were valued highly enough, Liquidation Valuation might give a higher value than other methodologies.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Let's go back to 2004 and look at Facebook back when it had no profit and no revenue. How would you value it?\n",
      "Answer: You would not use a \"far in the future DCF\" because it's too difficult to reasonably predict cash flows for a company that isn't even making money yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "You would use Comparable Companies and Precedent Transactions and look at more \"creative\" and industry specific multiples such as EV/Unique Visitors and EV/Pageviews rather than EV/Revenue or EV/EBITDA.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What would you use in conjunction with Free Cash Flow multiples - Equity Value or Enterprise Value?\n",
      "Answer: It depends, for Unlevered Free Cash Flow, you would use Enterprise Value, but for Levered Free Cash Flow you would use Equity Value.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is because Unlevered Free Cash Flow excludes Interest and thus represents money available to all investors, whereas Levered already includes Interest and the money is therefore only available to equity investors.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  You never use Equity Value / EBITDA, but are there any cases where you might use Equity Value / Revenue?\n",
      "Answer: It's very rare to see this, but sometimes large financial institutions with big cash balances have negative Enterprise Values - so you might use Equity Value / Revenue instead.\n",
      "You might see Equity Value / Revenue if you've listed a set of financial and non-financial companies on a slide, you're showing Revenue multiples for the non-financial companies, and you want to show something similar for the financials.\n",
      "Note, however, that in most cases you would be using other multiples such as P/E and P/BV with banks anyway.\n",

      "Question:  How do you select Comparable Companies / Precedent Transactions?\n",
      "Answer: The 3 main ways to select companies and transactions:\n",
      "1. Industry classification\n",
      "2. Financial criteria (Revenue, EBITDA, etc.)\n",
      "3. Geography\n",
      "For Precedent Transactions, you often limit the set based on date and only look at transactions within the past 1-2 years.\n",
      "The most important factor is industry - that is always used to screen for companies/transactions, and the rest may or may not be used depending on how specific you want to be.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you apply the 3 valuation methodologies to actually get a value for the\n",
      "company you're looking at?\n",
      "Answer: You take the median multiple of a set of companies or transactions, and then multiply it by the relevant metric from the company you're valuing.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the median EBITDA multiple from your set of Precedent Transactions is 8x and your company's EBITDA is $500 million, the implied Enterprise Value would be $4 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get the \"football field\" valuation graph you often see, you look at the minimum, maximum, 25th percentile and 75th percentile in each set as well and create a range of values based on each methodology.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What do you actually use a valuation for?\n",
      "Answer: 1. Pitch Book: Pitch books and in client presentations when you're providing updates and telling them what they should expect for their own valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Fairness Opinion: Right before a deal closes in a Fairness Opinion, a document a bank creates that \"proves\" the value their client is paying or receiving is \"fair\" from a financial point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Defense analyses, merger models, LBO models, DCFs (because terminal multiples are based off of comps), and pretty much anything else in finance.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why would a company with similar growth and profitability to its Comparable Companies be valued at a premium?\n",
      "Answer: • Earnings: The company has just reported earnings well-above expectations and its stock price has risen recently.\n",
      "• IP / Patents: It has some type of competitive advantage not reflected in its financials, such as a key patent or other intellectual property.\n",
      "• Favorable lawsuit: It has just won a favorable ruling in a major lawsuit.\n",
      "• Market share: It is the market leader in an industry and has greater market share than its competitors.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What are the flaws with public company comparables?\n",
      "Answer: • No company is 100% comparable to another company.\n",
      "• Emotional: The stock market is \"emotional\" - your multiples might be dramatically higher or lower on certain dates depending on the market's movements.\n",
      "• Small company: Share prices for small companies with thinly-traded stocks may not reflect their full value.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you take into account a company's competitive advantage in a valuation?\n",
      "Answer: 1. 75th: Look at the 75th percentile or higher for the multiples rather than the Medians.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Premium: Add in a premium to some of the multiples.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Use more aggressive projections for the company.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Do you ALWAYS use the median multiple of a set of public company comparables or precedent transactions?\n",
      "Answer: In most cases you do because you want to use values from the middle range of the set. But if the company you're valuing is distressed, is not performing well, or is at a competitive disadvantage, you might use the 25th percentile or something in the lower range instead - and vice versa if it's doing well.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  You mentioned that Precedent Transactions usually produce a higher value than Comparable Companies - can you think of a situation where this is not the case?\n",
      "Answer: Sometimes this happens when there is a substantial mismatch between the M&A market and the public market. For example, no public companies have been acquired recently but there have been a lot of small private companies acquired at extremely low valuations.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What are some flaws with precedent transactions?\n",
      "Answer: • Past transactions are rarely 100% comparable - the transaction structure, size of the company, and market sentiment all have huge effects.\n",
      "• Data on precedent transactions is generally more difficult to find than it is for public company comparables, especially for acquisitions of small private companies.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Two companies have the exact same financial profile and are bought by the same acquirer, but the EBITDA multiple for one transaction is twice the multiple of the other transaction - how could this happen?\n",
      "Answer: 1. Bidding War: One process was more competitive and had a lot more companies bidding on the target.\n",
      "2. Bad News --> low stock price: One company had recent bad news or a depressed stock price so it was acquired at a discount.\n",
      "3. Industry: They were in industries with different median multiples.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why does Warren Buffett prefer EBIT multiples to EBITDA multiples?\n",
      "Answer: Warren Buffett once famously said, \"Does management think the tooth fairy pays for capital expenditures?\" EBITDA because excludes the often sizable Capital Expenditures companies make and hides how much cash they are actually using to finance their operations.\n",
      "In some industries there is also a large gap between EBIT and EBITDA - anything that is very capital-intensive, for example, will show a big disparity.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  The EV / EBIT, EV / EBITDA, and P / E multiples all measure a company's profitability. What's the difference between them, and when do you use each one?\n",
      "Answer: P / E depends on the company's capital structure whereas EV / EBIT and EV / EBITDA are capital structure-neutral. Therefore, you use P / E for banks, financial institutions, and other companies where interest payments / expenses are critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "EV / EBIT includes Depreciation & Amortization whereas EV / EBITDA excludes it - you're more likely to use EV / EBIT in industries where D&A is large and where capital expenditures and fixed assets are important (e.g. manufacturing), and EV / EBITDA in industries where fixed assets are less important and where D&A is comparatively smaller (e.g. Internet companies).\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  If you were buying a vending machine business, would you pay a higher multiple for a business where you owned the machines and they depreciated normally, or one in which you leased the machines? The cost of depreciation and lease are the same dollar amounts and everything else is held constant.\n",
      "Answer: You would pay more for the one where you lease the machines. Enterprise Value would be the same for both companies, but with the depreciated situation the charge is not reflected in EBITDA - so EBITDA is higher, and the EV / EBITDA multiple is lower as a result. For the leased situation, the lease would show up in SG&A so it would be reflected in EBITDA, making EBITDA lower and the EV / EBITDA multiple higher.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you value a private company?\n",
      "Answer: You use the same methodologies as with public companies: public company comparables, precedent transactions, and DCF. But there are some differences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Discount for liquidity: You might apply a 10-15% (or more) discount to the public company comparable multiples because the private company you're valuing is not as \"liquid\" as the public comps.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. No premiums analysis: You can't use a premiums analysis or future share price analysis because a private company doesn't have a share price.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Straight to enterprise value: Your valuation shows the Enterprise Value for the company as opposed to the implied per-share price as with public companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. No BETA or Market Cap so WACC Hard: A DCF gets tricky because a private company doesn't have a market capitalization or Beta - you would probably just estimate WACC based on the public comps' WACC rather than trying to calculate it.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Let's say we're valuing a private company. Why might we discount the public company comparable multiples but not the precedent transaction multiples?\n",
      "Answer: There's no discount because with precedent transactions - regardless if it is public or private -, you're acquiring the entire company - and once it's acquired, the shares immediately become illiquid.\n",
      "\n",
      "But shares - the ability to buy individual \"pieces\" of a company rather than the whole thing - can be either liquid (if it's public) or illiquid (if it's private).\n",
      "Since shares of public companies are always more liquid, you would discount public company comparable multiples to account for this.\n",

      "Question:  Can you use private companies as part of your valuation?\n",
      "Answer: Only in the context of precedent transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would make no sense to include them for public company comparables, or for Cost of Equity / WACC calculation in a DCF because they are not public and therefore have no values for market cap or Beta.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you value banks and financial institutions differently from other companies?\n",
      "Answer: 1. Because banks have unique capital structures, you look at P / E and P / BV (Book Value) multiples rather than EV / Revenue, EV / EBITDA, and other \"normal\" multiples.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. You pay more attention to bank-specific metrics like NAV (Net Asset Value) and you might screen companies and precedent transactions based on those instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Rather than a DCF, you use a Dividend Discount Model (DDM) which is similar but is based on the present value of the company's dividends rather than its free cash flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is because interest is a critical component of a bank's revenue, and because debt is part of its business model rather than just a way to finance acquisitions or expand the business.\n",

      "Question:  Walk me through an IPO valuation for a company that's about to go public.\n",
      "Answer: 1. Unlike normal valuations, for an IPO valuation we only care about public company comparables.\n",
      "2. After picking the public company comparables we decide on the most relevant multiple to use and then estimate our company's Enterprise Value based on that.\n",
      "3. Once we have the Enterprise Value, we work backward to get to Equity Value and also subtract the IPO proceeds because this is \"new\" cash.\n",
      "4. Then we divide by the total number of shares (old and newly created) to get its per-share price. When people say \"An IPO priced at...\" this is what they're referring to.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you were using P / E or any other \"Equity Value-based multiple\" for the multiple in step #2 here, then you would get to Equity Value instead and then subtract the IPO proceeds from there.\n",

      "Question:  I'm looking at financial data for a public company comparable, and it's April (Q2) right now. Walk me through how you would \"calendarize\" this company's financial statements to show the Trailing Twelve Months as opposed to just the last Fiscal Year.\n",
      "Answer: The \"formula\" to calendarize financial statements is as follows:\n",
      "TTM = Most Recent Fiscal Year + New Partial Period - Old Partial Period\n",
      "\n",
      "So in the example above, we would take the company's Q1 numbers, add the most recent fiscal year's numbers, and then subtract the Q1 numbers from that most recent fiscal year.\n",
      "\n",
      "For US companies you can find these quarterly numbers in the 10-Q; for international companies they're in the \"interim\" reports.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Walk me through an M&A premiums analysis.\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of this analysis is to look at similar transactions and see the premiums that buyers have paid to sellers' share prices when acquiring them. For example, if a company is trading at $10.00/share and the buyer acquires it for $15.00/share, that's a 50% premium.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. First, select the precedent transactions based on industry, date (past 2-3 years for example), and size (example: over $1 billion market cap).\n",
      "2. For each transaction, get the seller's share price 1 day, 20 days, and 60 days before the transaction was announced (you can also look at even longer intervals, or 30 days, 45 days, etc.).\n",
      "3. Then, calculate the 1-day premium, 20-day premium, etc. by dividing the per- share purchase price by the appropriate share prices on each day.\n",
      "4. Get the medians for each set, and then apply them to your company's current share price, share price 20 days ago, etc. to estimate how much of a premium a buyer might pay for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that you only use this analysis when valuing public companies because private companies don't have share prices. Sometimes the set of companies here is exactly the same as your set of precedent transactions but typically it is broader.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Walk me through a future share price analysis.\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of this analysis is to project what a company's share price might be 1 or 2\n",
      "years from now and then discount it back to its present value.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Get the median historical (usually TTM) P / E of your public company comparables.\n",
      "2. Apply this P / E multiple to your company's 1-year forward or 2-year forward projected EPS to get its implied future share price.\n",
      "3. Then, discount this back to its present value by using a discount rate in-line with the company's Cost of Equity figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "You normally look at a range of P / E multiples as well as a range of discount rates for this type of analysis, and make a sensitivity table with these as inputs.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Both M&A premiums analysis and precedent transactions involve looking at previous M&A transactions. What's the difference in how we select them?\n",
      "Answer: • All the sellers in the M&A premiums analysis must be public.\n",
      "• Usually we use a broader set of transactions for M&A premiums - we might use fewer than 10 precedent transactions but we might have dozens of M&A premiums. The industry and financial screens are usually less stringent.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Walk me through a Sum-of-the-Parts analysis.\n",
      "Answer: In a Sum-of-the-Parts analysis, you value each division of a company using separate comparables and transactions, get to separate multiples, and then add up each division's value to get the total for the company.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you value Net Operating Losses and take them into account in a valuation?\n",
      "Answer: You value NOLs based on how much they'll save the company in taxes in future years, and then take the present value of the sum of tax savings in future years. Two ways to assess the tax savings in future years:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Assume that a company can use its NOLs to completely offset its taxable income until the NOLs run out.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. In an acquisition scenario, use Section 382 and calculate:\n",
      "\n",
      "adjusted long-term rate * the equity purchase price = maximum allowed NOL usage in each year\n",
      "\n",
      "use that to figure out the offset to taxable income.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might look at NOLs in a valuation but you rarely add them in - if you did, they would be similar to cash and you would subtract NOLs to go from Equity Value to Enterprise Value, and vice versa.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  I have a set of public company comparables and need to get the projections from equity research. How do I select which report to use?\n",
      "Answer: This varies by bank and group, but two common methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. You pick the report with the most detailed information.\n",
      "2. You pick the report with numbers in the middle of the range.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  I have a set of precedent transactions but I'm missing information like EBITDA for a lot of the companies - how can I find it if it's not available via public sources?\n",
      "Answer: 1. Press releases: and see if you can find press releases or articles in the financial press with these numbers.\n",
      "2. Buy-side equity research: Failing that, look in equity research for the buyer around the time of the transaction and see if any of the analysts estimate the seller's numbers.\n",
      "3. Online sources: Also look on online sources like Capital IQ and Factset and see if any of them disclose numbers or give estimates.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How far back and forward do we usually go for public company comparable and precedent transaction multiples?\n",
      "Answer: Usually you look at the TTM (Trailing Twelve Months) period for both sets, and then you look forward either 1 or 2 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "You're more likely to look backward more than 1 year and go forward more than 2 years for public company comparables; for precedent transactions it's odd to go forward more than 1 year because your information is more limited.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  I have one company with a 40% EBITDA margin trading at 8x EBITDA, and another company with a 10% EBITDA margin trading at 16x EBITDA. What's the problem with comparing these two valuations directly?\n",
      "Answer: There's no \"rule\" that says this is wrong or not allowed, but it can be misleading to compare companies with dramatically different margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to basic arithmetic, the 40% margin company will usually have a lower multiple - whether or not its actual value is lower.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Walk me through how we might value an oil & gas company and how it's different from a \"standard\" company.\n",
      "Answer: You use the same methodologies, except:\n",
      "\n",
      "• You look at industry-specific multiples like P / MCFE and P / NAV in addition to the more standard ones.\n",
      "• You need to project the prices of commodities like oil and natural gas, and also the company's reserves to determine its revenue and cash flows in future years.\n",
      "• Rather than a DCF, you use a NAV (Net Asset Value) model - it's similar, but everything flows from the company's reserves rather than simple revenue growth / EBITDA margin projections.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to all of the above, there are also some accounting complications with energy companies and you need to think about what a \"proven\" reserve is vs. what is more speculative.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Walk me through how we would value a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) and how it differs from a \"normal\" company.\n",
      "Answer: Similar to energy, real estate is asset-intensive and a company's value depends on how much cash flow specific properties generate.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Multiples: You look at Price / FFO (Funds From Operations) and Price / AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations), which add back Depreciation and subtract gains on property sales; NAV (Net Asset Value) is also important.\n",
      "2. NOI: You value properties by dividing Net Operating Income (NOI) (Property's Gross Income - Operating Expenses) by the capitalization rate (based on market data).\n",
      "3. Replacement Valuation is more common because you can actually estimate the cost of buying new land and building new properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "------------------------\n",

      "First, you project out a company's financials using assumptions for revenue growth, expenses and Working Capital; then you get down to Free Cash Flow for each year, which you then sum up and discount to a Net Present Value, based on your discount rate - usually the Weighted Average Cost of Capital.\n",

      "Answer: This is based on relationships - banks develop relationships over the years before they need anything. When the time comes for a deal, the company calls different banks it has spoken to and asks them to pitch for the business. This is called a \"bake-off,\" which is what banks use to select a \"winner\" they are working with.\n",

      "Answer: ECM and DCM are both more \"markets-based\" than M&A. In M&A your job is to execute sell-side and buy-side transactions, whereas in ECM/DCM most of your tasks are related to staying on top of the market, following current trends, and making recommendations to industry and product groups for clients and pitch books.\n",

      "Answer: Divesture is when a company (public or private) decides to sell specific divisions rather than the entire company. The basics of a sell-side M&A deal are the same, but get messier from a modeling and financial perspective, because naturally you are dealing with part of a company. Not the entire thing.\n",

      "Question:  What's an alternate way to calculate Free Cash Flow aside from taking Net Income, adding back Depreciation, and subtracting Changes in Operating Assets / Liabilities and CapEx?\n",
      "Answer: Take Cash Flow From Operations and subtract CapEx - that gets you to Levered Cash Flow. To get to Unlevered Cash Flow, you then need to add back the tax-adjusted Interest Expense and subtract the tax-adjusted Interest Income.\n",

      "Question:  Why do you use 5 or 10 years for DCF projections?\n",
      "Answer: That's usually about as far as you can reasonably predict into the future. Less than 5 years would be too short to be useful, and over 10 years is too difficult to predict for most companies.\n",

      "For Cost of Equity, you can use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM - see the next question) and for the others you usually look at comparable companies/debt issuances and the interest rates and yields issued by similar companies to get estimates\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you calculate the Cost of Equity?\n",
      "Answer: Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium\n",
      "\n",
      "he risk-free rate represents how much a 10-year or 20-year US Treasury should yield; Beta is calculated based on the \"riskiness\" of Comparable Companies and the Equity Risk Premium is the % by which stocks are expected to out-perform \"risk-less\" assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Normally you pull the Equity Risk Premium from a publication called Ibbotson's.\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you get to Beta in the Cost of Equity calculation?\n",
      "Answer: You look up the Beta for each Comparable Company (usually on Bloomberg), un-lever each one, take the median of the set and then lever it based on your company's capital structure. Then you use this Levered Beta in the Cost of Equity calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Un-Levered Beta = Levered Beta / (1 + ((Total Debt/Equity) x(1 - Tax Rate)))\n",
      "\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why do you have to un-lever and re-lever Beta?\n",
      "Answer: When you look up the Betas on Bloomberg (or from whatever source you're using) they will be levered to reflect the debt already assumed by each company.\n",
      "\n",
      "But each company's capital structure is different and we want to look at how \"risky\" a company is regardless of what % debt or equity it has.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get that, we need to un-lever Beta each time.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at the end of the calculation, we need to re-lever it because we want the Beta used in the Cost of Equity calculation to reflect the true risk of our company, taking into account its capital structure this time.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Would you expect a manufacturing company or a technology company to have a higher Beta?\n",
      "Answer: A technology company, because technology is viewed as a \"riskier\" industry than manufacturing.\n",

      "Question:  Let's say that you use Levered Free Cash Flow rather than Unlevered Free Cash Flow in your DCF - what is the effect?\n",
      "Answer: Levered Free Cash Flow gives you Equity Value rather than Enterprise Value, since the cash flow is only available to equity investors (debt investors have already been \"paid\" with the interest payments).\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  If you use Levered Free Cash Flow, what should you use as the Discount Rate?\n",

      "Question:  How do you calculate the Terminal Value?\n",
      "Answer: You can either apply an exit multiple to the company's Year 5 EBITDA, EBIT or Free Cash Flow (Multiples Method) or you can use the Gordon Growth method to estimate its value based on its growth rate into perpetuity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The formula for Terminal Value using Gordon Growth is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Terminal Value =\n",
      "Year 5 Free Cash Flow * (1 + Growth Rate)\n",
      "/ (Discount Rate - Growth Rate)\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why would you use Gordon Growth rather than the Multiples Method to calculate the Terminal Value?\n",
      "Answer: You might use Gordon Growth if you have no good Comparable Companies or if you have reason to believe that multiples will change significantly in the industry several years down the road. For example, if an industry is very cyclical you might be better off using long-term growth rates rather than exit multiples.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What's an appropriate growth rate to use when calculating the Terminal Value?\n",
      "Answer: Normally you use the country's long-term GDP growth rate, the rate of inflation, or something similarly conservative.\n",
      "For companies in mature economies, a long-term growth rate over 5% would be quite aggressive since most developed economies are growing at less than 5% per year.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you select the appropriate exit multiple when calculating Terminal Value?\n",
      "Answer: Normally you look at the Comparable Companies and pick the median of the set, or something close to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with almost anything else in finance, you always show a range of exit multiples and what the Terminal Value looks like over that range rather than picking one specific number.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Which method of calculating Terminal Value will give you a higher valuation?\n",
      "Answer: It's hard to generalize because both are highly dependent on the assumptions you make. In general, the Multiples Method will be more variable than the Gordon Growth method because exit multiples tend to span a wider range than possible long-term growth rates.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What's the flaw with basing terminal multiples on what public company comparables are trading at?\n",
      "Answer: The median multiples may change greatly in the next 5-10 years so it may no longer be accurate by the end of the period you're looking at. This is why you normally look at a wide range of multiples and do a sensitivity to see how the valuation changes over that range.\n",
      "This method is particularly problematic with cyclical industries (e.g. semiconductors).\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you know if your DCF is too dependent on future assumptions?\n",
      "Answer: If significantly more than 50% of the company's Enterprise Value comes from its Terminal Value, your DCF is probably too dependent on future assumptions.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Should Cost of Equity be higher for a $5 billion or $500 million market cap company?\n",
      "Answer: It should be higher for the $500 million company, because all else being equal, smaller companies are expected to outperform large companies in the stock market (and therefore be \"more risky\"). Using a Size Premium in your calculation would also ensure that Cost of Equity is higher for the $500 million company.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What about WACC - will it be higher for a $5 billion or $500 million company?\n",
      "Answer: This is a bit of a trick question because it depends on whether or not the capital structure is the same for both companies. If the capital structure is the same in terms of percentages and interest rates and such, then WACC should be higher for the $500 million company for the same reasons as mentioned above.\n",
      "\n",

      "Question:  Cost of Equity tells us what kind of return an equity investor can expect for investing in a given company - but what about dividends? Shouldn't we factor dividend yield into the formula?\n",

      "Question:  Two companies are exactly the same, but one has debt and one does not - which one will have the higher WACC?\n",
      "Answer: This is tricky - the one without debt will have a higher WACC up to a certain point, because debt is \"less expensive\" than equity. Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "• Interest on debt is tax-deductible (hence the (1 - Tax Rate) multiplication in the WACC formula).\n",
      "\n",
      "• Debt is senior to equity in a company's capital structure - debt holders would be paid first in a liquidation or bankruptcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Intuitively, interest rates on debt are usually lower than the Cost of Equity numbers you see (usually over 10%). As a result, the Cost of Debt portion of WACC will contribute less to the total figure than the Cost of Equity portion will.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the above is true only to a certain point. Once a company's debt goes up high enough, the interest rate will rise dramatically to reflect the additional risk and so the Cost of Debt would start to increase - if it gets high enough, it might become higher than Cost of Equity and additional debt would increase WACC.\n",

      "Question:  Which has a greater impact on a company's DCF valuation - a 10% change in revenue or a 1% change in the discount rate?\n",
      "Answer: You should start by saying, \"it depends\" but most of the time the 10% difference in revenue will have more of an impact. That change in revenue doesn't affect only the current year's revenue, but also the revenue/EBITDA far into the future and even the terminal value.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What about a 1% change in revenue vs. a 1% change in the discount rate?\n",

      "Answer: You don't account for this at all in a DCF, because paying off debt principal shows up in Cash Flow from Financing on the Cash Flow Statement - but we only go down to Cash Flow from Operations and then subtract Capital Expenditures to get to Free Cash Flow.\n",
      "\n",

      "Question:  Explain why we would use the mid-year convention in a DCF.\n",

      "Question:  What discount period numbers would I use for the mid-year convention if I have a stub period - e.g. Q4 of Year 1 - in my DCF?\n",

      "\n",
      "• Multiples Method: You add 0.5 to the final year discount number to reflect the fact that you're assuming the company gets sold at the end of the year.\n",

      "Question:  If I'm working with a public company in a DCF, how do I calculate its per-share value?\n",
      "Answer: Once you get to Enterprise Value, ADD cash and then subtract debt, preferred stock, and minority interest (and any other debt-like items) to get to Equity Value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, you need to use a circular calculation that takes into account the basic shares outstanding, options, warrants, convertibles, and other dilutive securities. It's circular because the dilution from these depends on the per-share price - but the per-share price depends on number of shares outstanding, which depends on the per-share price.\n",

      "Question:  What's the difference between a merger and an acquisition?\n",
      "Answer: There's always a buyer and a seller in any M&A deal - the difference between \"merger\" and \"acquisition\" is more semantic than anything. In a merger the companies are close to the same size, whereas in an acquisition the buyer is significantly larger.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why would a company want to acquire another company?\n",
      "Answer: • Market share: The buyer wants to gain market share by buying a competitor.\n",
      "• Grow: The buyer needs to grow more quickly and sees an acquisition as a way to do that.\n",
      "• Undervalue: The buyer believes the seller is undervalued.\n",
      "• Customer base: The buyer wants to acquire the seller's customers so it can up-sell and cross-sell to them.\n",
      "• Intangible Assets: The buyer thinks the seller has a critical technology, intellectual property or some other \"secret sauce\" it can use to significantly enhance its business.\n",
      "• Synergies: The buyer believes it can achieve significant synergies and therefore make the deal accretive for its shareholders.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why would an acquisition be dilutive?\n",
      "Answer: An acquisition is dilutive if the additional amount of Net Income the seller contributes is not enough to offset the buyer's foregone interest on cash, additional interest paid on debt, and the effects of issuing additional shares.\n",
      "Acquisition effects - such as amortization of intangibles - can also make an acquisition dilutive.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Is there a rule of thumb for calculating whether an acquisition will be accretive or dilutive?\n",
      "Answer: If the deal involves just cash and debt, you can sum up the interest expense for debt and the foregone interest on cash, then compare it against the seller's Pre-Tax Income.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if it's an all-stock deal you can use a shortcut to assess whether it is accretive (see question #5).\n",
      "But if the deal involves cash, stock, and debt, there's no quick rule-of-thumb you can use unless you're lightning fast with mental math.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  A company with a higher P/E acquires one with a lower P/E - is this accretive or dilutive?\n",
      "Answer: You can't tell unless you also know that it's an all-stock deal. If it's an all-cash or all-debt deal, the P/E multiples of the buyer and seller don't matter because no stock is being issued.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, generally getting more earnings for less is good and is more likely to be accretive but there's no hard-and-fast rule unless it's an all-stock deal.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What is the rule of thumb for assessing whether an M&A deal will be accretive or dilutive?\n",
      "Answer: In an all-stock deal, if the buyer has a higher P/E than the seller, it will be accretive; if the buyer has a lower P/E, it will be dilutive.\n",
      "\n",
      "On an intuitive level if you're paying more for earnings than what the market values your own earnings at, you can guess that it will be dilutive; and likewise, if you're paying less for earnings than what the market values your own earnings at, you can guess that it would be accretive.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What are the complete effects of an acquisition?\n",
      "Answer: 1. Foregone Interest on Cash - The buyer loses the Interest it would have otherwise earned if it uses cash for the acquisition.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Additional Interest on Debt - The buyer pays additional Interest Expense if it uses debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Additional Shares Outstanding - If the buyer pays with stock, it must issue additional shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Creation of Goodwill & Other Intangibles - These Balance Sheet items that represent a \"premium\" paid to a company's \"fair value\" also get created.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Combined Financial Statements - After the acquisition, the seller's financials are added to the buyer's.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  If a company were capable of paying 100% in cash for another company, why would it choose NOT to do so?\n",
      "Answer: 1. It might be saving its cash for something else\n",
      "2. It might be concerned about running low if business takes a turn for the worst\n",
      "3. Its stock may also be trading at an all-time high and it might be eager to use that instead\n",
      "\n",
      "(in finance terms this would be \"more expensive\" but a lot of executives value having a safety cushion in the form of a large cash balance).\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why would a strategic acquirer typically be willing to pay more for a company than a private equity firm would?\n",
      "Answer: Because the strategic acquirer can realize revenue and cost synergies that the private equity firm cannot unless it combines the company with a complementary portfolio company. Those synergies boost the effective valuation for the target company.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why do Goodwill & Other Intangibles get created in an acquisition?\n",
      "Answer: These represent the premium / value over the \"fair market value\" of the seller that the buyer has paid. You calculate the number by subtracting the book value of a company from its equity purchase price.\n",
      "\n",
      "More specifically, Goodwill and Other Intangibles represent things like the value of customer relationships, brand names and intellectual property - valuable, but not true financial Assets that show up on the Balance Sheet.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What is the difference between Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets?\n",
      "Answer: Goodwill typically stays the same over many years and is not amortized. It changes only if there's goodwill impairment (or another acquisition).\n",
      "\n",
      "Other Intangible Assets, by contrast, are amortized over several years and affect the Income Statement by hitting the Pre-Tax Income line.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Is there anything else \"intangible\" besides Goodwill & Other Intangibles that could also impact the combined company?\n",
      "Answer: Yes. You could also have a Purchased In-Process R&D Write-off and a Deferred Revenue Write-off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first refers to any Research & Development projects that were purchased in the acquisition but which have not been completed yet. The logic is that unfinished R&D projects require significant resources to complete, and as such, the \"expense\" must be recognized as part of the acquisition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second refers to cases where the seller has collected cash for a service but not yet recorded it as revenue, and the buyer must write-down the value of the Deferred Revenue to avoid \"double-counting\" revenue.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What are synergies, and can you provide a few examples?\n",
      "Answer: Synergies refer to cases where the buyer gets more value than out of an acquisition than what the financials would predict.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are 2 types: revenue synergies and cost (or expense) synergies.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Revenue Synergies: The combined company can cross-sell products to new customers or up-sell new products to existing customers. It might also be able to expand into new geographies as a result of the deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Cost Synergies: The combined company can consolidate buildings and administrative staff and can lay off redundant employees. It might also be able to shut down redundant stores or locations.\n",

      "Question:  How are synergies used in merger models?\n",
      "Answer: Revenue Synergies: Normally you add these to the Revenue figure for the combined company and then assume a certain margin on the Revenue - this additional Revenue then flows through the rest of the combined Income Statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost Synergies: Normally you reduce the combined COGS or Operating Expenses by this amount, which in turn boosts the combined Pre-Tax Income and thus Net Income, raising the EPS and making the deal more accretive.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Are revenue or cost synergies more important?\n",
      "Answer: No one in M&A takes revenue synergies seriously because they're so hard to predict. Cost synergies are taken a bit more seriously because it's more straightforward to see how buildings and locations might be consolidated and how many redundant employees might be eliminated.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  All else being equal, which method would a company prefer to use when acquiring another company - cash, stock, or debt?\n",
      "Answer: Assuming the buyer had unlimited resources, it would always prefer to use cash when buying another company. Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "• Cash is \"cheaper\" than debt because interest rates on cash are usually under 5% whereas debt interest rates are almost always higher than that. Thus, foregone interest on cash is almost always less than additional interest paid on debt for the same amount of cash/debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Cash is also less \"risky\" than debt because there's no chance the buyer might fail to raise sufficient funds from investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "• It's hard to compare the \"cost\" directly to stock, but in general stock is the most \"expensive\" way to finance a transaction - remember how the Cost of Equity is almost always higher than the Cost of Debt? That same principle applies here.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Cash is also less risky than stock because the buyer's share price could change dramatically once the acquisition is announced.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How much debt could a company issue in a merger or acquisition?\n",
      "Answer: Generally you would look at Comparable Companies/ Precedent Transactions to determine this. You would use the combined company's LTM (Last Twelve Months) EBITDA figure, find the median Debt/EBITDA ratio of whatever companies you're looking at, and apply that to your own EBITDA figure to get a rough idea of how much debt you could raise.\n",
      "\n",
      "You would also look at \"Debt Comps\" for companies in the same industry and see what types of debt and how many tranches they have used.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you determine the Purchase Price for the target company in an acquisition?\n",
      "Answer: You use the same Valuation methodologies we already discussed. If the seller is a public company, you would pay more attention to the premium paid over the current share price to make sure it's \"sufficient\" (generally in the 15-30% range) to win shareholder approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "For private sellers, more weight is placed on the traditional methodologies.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Let's say a company overpays for another company - what typically happens afterwards and can you give any recent examples?\n",
      "Answer: There would be an incredibly high amount of Goodwill & Other Intangibles created if the price is far above the fair market value of the company. Depending on how the acquisition goes, there might be a large goodwill impairment charge later on if the company decides it overpaid.\n",
      "\n",
      "A recent example is _________\n",
      "\n",
      "the eBay / Skype deal, in which eBay paid a huge premium and extremely high multiple for Skype. It created excess Goodwill & Other Intangibles, and eBay later ended up writing down much of the value and taking a large quarterly loss as a result.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  A buyer pays $100 million for the seller in an all-stock deal, but a day later the market decides it's only worth $50 million. What happens?\n",
      "Answer: The buyer's share price would fall by whatever per-share dollar amount corresponds to the $50 million loss in value. Note that it would not necessarily be cut in half.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on how the deal was structured, the seller would effectively only be receiving half of what it had originally negotiated.\n",
      "\n",
      "This illustrates one of the major risks of all-stock deals: sudden changes in share price could dramatically impact valuation.\n",

      "Question:  Why do most mergers and acquisitions fail?\n",
      "Answer: Like so many things, M&A is \"easier said than done.\" In practice it's very difficult to acquire and integrate a different company, actually realize synergies and also turn the acquired company into a profitable division.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many deals are also done for the wrong reasons, such as CEO ego or pressure from shareholders. Any deal done without both parties' best interests in mind is likely to fail.\n",

      "Question:  What role does a merger model play in deal negotiations?\n",
      "Answer: The model is used as a sanity check and is used to test various assumptions. A company would never decide to do a deal based on the output of a model.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might say, \"Ok, the model tells us this deal could work and be moderately accretive - it's worth exploring more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It would never say, \"Aha! This model predicts 21% accretion - we should definitely acquire them now!\"\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What types of sensitivities would you look at in a merger model? What variables would you look at?\n",
      "Answer: The most common variables to look at are Purchase Price, % Stock/Cash/Debt, Revenue Synergies, and Expense Synergies. Sometimes you also look at different operating sensitivities, like Revenue Growth or EBITDA Margin, but it's more common to build these into your model as different scenarios instead.\n",
      "\n",

      "Question:  What's the difference between Purchase Accounting and Pooling Accounting in an M&A deal?\n",
      "Answer: In purchase accounting the seller's shareholders' equity number is wiped out and the premium paid over that value is recorded as Goodwill on the combined balance sheet post-acquisition.\n",
      "\n",
      "In pooling accounting, you simply combine the 2 shareholders' equity numbers rather than worrying about Goodwill and the related items that get created.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are specific requirements for using pooling accounting, so in 99% of M&A deals you will use purchase accounting.\n",

      "\n",
      "If Microsoft acquired it, we might assume that they could boost this RPS by $0.01 or $0.02 because of their superior monetization. So to calculate the additional revenue from this synergy, we would multiply this $0.01 or $0.02 by Yahoo's total # of searches, get the total additional revenue, and then select a margin on it to determine how much flows through to the combined company's Operating Income\n",

Microsoft calculates that post-transaction, it will only need about 200 of Yahoo's SG&A employees, and its existing employees can take over the rest of the work. To calculate the Operating Expenses the combined company would save, we would multiply these 800 employees Microsoft is going to fire post-transaction by their average salary.

      "\n",
      "These get created when you write up assets - both tangible and intangible - and when you write down assets in a transaction. An asset write-up creates a deferred tax liability, and an asset write-down creates a deferred tax asset.\n",

      "Deferred Tax Asset = Asset Write-Down * Tax Rate\n",

      "Here's what would happen to the combined company's balance sheet (ignoring transaction/financing fees):\n",
      "• First, you simply add the seller's Assets and Liabilities (but NOT Shareholders' Equity - it is wiped out) to the buyer's to get your \"initial\" balance sheet. Assets are up by Asset value of seller and Liabilities are up by Liabilities of the seller.\n",
      "• Then, Cash on the Assets side goes down by cash paid and Debt on the Liabilities & Equity side goes up by debt used million.\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Could you get DTLs or DTAs in an asset purchase?\n",
      "Answer: No, because in an asset purchase the book basis of assets always matches the tax basis. They get created in a stock purchase because the book values of assets are written up or written down, but the tax values are not.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you account for DTLs in forward projections in a merger model?\n",
      "Answer: You create a book vs. cash tax schedule to figure out the difference between what the company owes in taxes based on Pretax Income on its books, and what it actually pays in cash taxes accounting for NOLs and new amortization and depreciation expenses (from asset write-ups).\n",
      "\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Explain why we would write down the seller's existing Deferred Tax Asset in an M&A deal.\n",

      "Question:  What's a Section 338(h)(10) election and why might a company want to use it in an M&A deal?\n",
      "Answer: A Section 338(h)(10) election blends the benefits of a stock purchase and an asset purchase:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Legally it is a stock purchase, but accounting-wise it's treated like an asset purchase.\n",
      "• The seller is still subject to double-taxation - on its assets that have appreciated and on the proceeds from the sale.\n",
      "• But the buyer receives a step-up tax basis on the new assets it acquires, and it can depreciate/amortize them so it saves on taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the seller still gets taxed twice, buyers will often pay more in a 338(h)(10) deal because of the tax-savings potential. It's particularly helpful for:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Sellers with high NOL balances (more tax-savings for the buyer because this NOL balance will be written down completely - and so more of the excess purchase price can be allocated to asset write-ups).\n",
      "• If the company has been an S-corporation for over 10 years - in this case it doesn't have to pay a tax on the appreciation of its assets.\n",

      "Answer: An exchange ratio is an alternate way of structuring a 100% stock M&A deal, or any M&A deal with a portion of stock involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Normally in an all-stock deal you would determine how much stock to issue by dividing the purchase price by the buyer's stock price, and to get the new share count.\n",
      "\n",
      "With an exchange ratio, by contrast, you would tie the number of new shares to the buyer's own shares, fixing the amount of shares that the seller receives - no matter the final dollar amount of the buyers shares.\n",

      "\n",

      "1. Combine the buyer's and seller's balance sheets (except for the seller's Shareholders' Equity number).\n",
      "2. Make the necessary Pro-Forma Adjustments (cash, debt, goodwill/intangibles, etc.).\n",

      "\n",
      "Stock Purchase\n",
      "• Most common for public companies and larger private companies.\n",
      "• Buyer acquires all asset and liabilities of the seller as well as off-balance sheet items.\n",
      "• The seller is taxed at the capital gains tax rate.\n",
      "• The buyer receives no step-up tax basis for the newly acquired assets, and it can't\n",
      "depreciate/amortize them for tax purposes.\n",
      "• A Deferred Tax Liability gets created as a result of the above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asset Purchase:\n",
      "• Most common for private companies, divestitures, and distressed public companies.\n",
      "• Buyer acquires only certain assets and assumes only certain liabilities of the seller and gets nothing else.\n",
      "• Seller is taxed on the amount its assets have appreciated (what the buyer is paying for each one minus its book value) and also pays a capital gains tax on the proceeds.\n",
      "• The buyer receives a step-up tax basis for the newly acquired assets, and it can depreciate/amortize them for tax purposes.\n",
      "• No Deferred Tax Liability is created as a result of the above.\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Would a seller prefer a stock purchase or an asset purchase? What about the buyer?\n",
      "Answer: A seller almost always prefers a stock purchase to avoid double taxation and to get rid of all its liabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The buyer almost always prefers an asset deal so it can be more careful about what it acquires and to get the tax benefit from being able to deduct depreciation and amortization of asset write-ups for tax purposes.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Explain what a contribution analysis is and why we might look at it in a merger model.\n",
      "Answer: A contribution analysis compares how much revenue, EBITDA, Pre-Tax Income, cash, and possibly other items the buyer and seller are \"contributing\" to estimate what the ownership of the combined company should be based on this difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's most common to look at this with merger of equals scenarios, and less common when the buyer is significantly larger than the seller.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you account for transaction costs, financing fees, and miscellaneous expenses in a merger model?\n",
      "Answer: Financing fees are capitalized and amortized over the life of the debt, while transaction and miscellaneous fees are expensed upfront.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expensed transaction fees come out of Retained Earnings when you adjust the Balance Sheet, while capitalized financing fees appear as a new Asset on the Balance Sheet and are amortized each year according to the tenor of the debt.\n",

      "Question:  Walk me through a basic LBO model.\n",
      "Answer: In an LBO Model, Step 1 is making assumptions about the Purchase Price, Debt/Equity ratio, Interest Rate on Debt and other variables; you might also assume something about the company's operations, such as Revenue Growth or Margins, depending on how much information you have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2 is to create a Sources & Uses section, which shows how you finance the transaction and what you use the capital for; this also tells you how much Investor Equity is required.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3 is to adjust the company's Balance Sheet for the new Debt and Equity figures, and also add in Goodwill & Other Intangibles on the Assets side to make everything balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Step 4, you project out the company's Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement, and determine how much debt is paid off each year, based on the available Cash Flow and the required Interest Payments.\n",

      "Question:  Why would you use leverage when buying a company?\n",
      "Answer: To boost your return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, any debt you use in an LBO is not \"your money\" - so if you're paying $5 billion for a company, it's easier to earn a high return on $2 billion of your own money and $3 billion borrowed from elsewhere vs. $3 billion of your own money and $2 billion of borrowed money.\n",
      "\n",
      "A secondary benefit is that the firm also has more capital available to purchase other companies because they've used leverage.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What variables impact an LBO model the most?\n",
      "Answer: 1. Purchase and exit multiples have the biggest impact on the returns of a model\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How do you pick purchase multiples and exit multiples in an LBO model?\n",
      "Answer: You look at what comparable companies are trading at, and what multiples similar LBO transactions have had. As always, you also show a range of purchase and exit multiples using sensitivity tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes you set purchase and exit multiples based on a specific IRR target that you're trying to achieve - but this is just for valuation purposes if you're using an LBO model to value the company.\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Can you explain how the Balance Sheet is adjusted in an LBO model?\n",
      "Answer: First, the Liabilities & Equities side is adjusted - the new debt is added on, and the Shareholders' Equity is \"wiped out\" and replaced by however much equity the private equity firm is contributing.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the Assets side, Cash is adjusted for any cash used to finance the transaction, and then Goodwill & Other Intangibles are used as a \"plug\" to make the Balance Sheet balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on the transaction, there could be other effects as well - such as capitalized financing fees added to the Assets side.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why are Goodwill & Other Intangibles created in an LBO?\n",
      "Answer: Remember, these both represent the premium paid to the \"fair market value\" of the company. In an LBO, they act as a \"plug\" and ensure that the changes to the Liabilities & Equity side are balanced by changes to the Assets side.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  We saw that a strategic acquirer will usually prefer to pay for another company in cash - if that's the case, why would a PE firm want to use debt in an LBO?\n",
      "Answer: It's a different scenario because:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The PE firm does not intend to hold the company for the long-term - it usually sells it after a few years, so it is less concerned with the \"expense\" of cash vs. debt and more concerned about using leverage to boost its returns by reducing the amount of capital it has to contribute upfront.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. In an LBO, the debt is \"owned\" by the company, so they assume much of the risk. Whereas in a strategic acquisition, the buyer \"owns\" the debt so it is more risky for them.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Do you need to project all 3 statements in an LBO model? Are there any \"shortcuts?\"\n",
      "Answer: Yes, there are shortcuts and you don't necessarily need to project all 3 statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, you do not need to create a full Balance Sheet - bankers sometimes skip this if they are in a rush. You do need some form of Income Statement, something to track how the Debt balances change and some type of Cash Flow Statement to show how much cash is available to repay debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a full-blown Balance Sheet is not strictly required, because you can just make assumptions on the Net Change in Working Capital rather than looking at each item individually.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How would you determine how much debt can be raised in an LBO and how many tranches there would be?\n",
      "Answer: Usually you would look at Comparable LBOs and see the terms of the debt and how many tranches each of them used. You would look at companies in a similar size range and industry and use those criteria to determine the debt your company can raise.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Let's say we're analyzing how much debt a company can take on, and what the terms of the debt should be. What are reasonable leverage and coverage ratios?\n",
      "Answer: This is completely dependent on the company, the industry, and the leverage and coverage ratios for comparable LBO transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "To figure out the numbers, you would look at \"debt comps\" showing the types, tranches, and terms of debt that similarly sized companies in the industry have used recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some general rules: for example, you would never lever a company at 50x EBITDA, and even during the bubble leverage rarely exceeded 5-10x EBITDA.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What is the difference between bank debt and high-yield debt?\n",
      "Answer: This is a simplification, but broadly speaking there are 2 \"types\" of debt: \"bank debt\" and \"high-yield debt.\" There are many differences, but here are a few of the most important ones:\n",
      "\n",
      "• High-yield debt tends to have higher interest rates than bank debt (hence the name \"high-yield\").\n",
      "\n",
      "• High-yield debt interest rates are usually fixed, whereas bank debt interest rates are \"floating\" - they change based on LIBOR or the Fed interest rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "• High-yield debt has incurrence covenants while bank debt has maintenance covenants. The main difference is that incurrence covenants prevent you from doing something (such as selling an asset, buying a factory, etc.) while maintenance covenants require you to maintain a minimum financial performance (for example, the Debt/EBITDA ratio must be below 5x at all times).\n",
      "\n",
      "• Bank debt is usually amortized - the principal must be paid off over time - whereas with high-yield debt, the entire principal is due at the end (bullet maturity).\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually in a sizable Leveraged Buyout, the PE firm uses both types of debt.\n",
      "Again, there are many different types of debt - this is a simplification, but it's enough for entry-level interviews.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why might you use bank debt rather than high-yield debt in an LBO?\n",
      "Answer: If the PE firm or the company is concerned about meeting interest payments and wants a lower-cost option, they might use bank debt; they might also use bank debt if they are planning on major expansion or Capital Expenditures and don't want to be restricted by incurrence covenants.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why would a PE firm prefer high-yield debt instead?\n",
      "Answer: 1. If the PE firm intends to refinance the company at some point\n",
      "\n",
      "2. If they don't believe their returns are too sensitive to interest payments, they might use high-yield debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. They might also use the high-yield option if they don't have plans for major expansion or selling off the company's assets.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Why would a private equity firm buy a company in a \"risky\" industry, such as technology?\n",
      "Answer: Although technology is more \"risky\" than other markets, remember that there are mature, cash flow-stable companies in almost every industry. There are some PE firms that specialize in very specific goals, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Industry consolidation - buying competitors in a similar market and combining them to increase efficiency and win more customers.\n",
      "• Turnarounds - taking struggling companies and making them function properly again.\n",
      "• Divestitures - selling off divisions of a company or taking a division and turning it into a strong stand-alone entity.\n",
      "\n",
      "So even if a company isn't doing well or seems risky, the firm might buy it if it falls into one of these categories.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  How could a private equity firm boost its return in an LBO?\n",
      "Answer: 1. Lower the Purchase Price in the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Raise the Exit Multiple / Exit Price.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Increase the Leverage (debt) used.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Increase the company's growth rate (organically or via acquisitions).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Increase margins by reducing expenses (cutting employees, consolidating\n",
      "buildings, etc.).\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  What is meant by the \"tax shield\" in an LBO?\n",
      "Answer: This means that the interest a firm pays on debt is tax-deductible - so they save money on taxes and therefore increase their cash flow as a result of having debt from the LBO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note, however, that their cash flow is still lower than it would be without the debt - saving on taxes helps, but the added interest expenses still reduces Net Income over what it would be for a debt-free company.\n",

      "Question:  What is a dividend recapitalization (\"dividend recap\")?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why would a PE firm choose to do a dividend recap of one of its portfolio companies?\n",
      "Answer: In a dividend recap, the company takes on new debt solely to pay a special dividend out to the PE firm that bought it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be like if you made your friend take out a personal loan just so he/she could pay you a lump sum of cash with the loan proceeds.\n",

      "Primarily to boost returns. Remember, all else being equal, more leverage means a higher return to the firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a dividend recap, the PE firm is \"recovering\" some of its equity investment in the company - and as we saw earlier, the lower the equity investment, the better, since it's easier to earn a higher return on a smaller amount of capital.\n",

      "Question:  How would an asset write-up or write-down affect an LBO model? / Walk me through how you adjust the Balance Sheet in an LBO model.\n",
      "Answer: All of this is very similar to what you would see in a merger model - you calculate Goodwill, Other Intangibles, and the rest of the write-ups in the same way, and then the Balance Sheet adjustments (e.g. subtracting cash, adding in capitalized financing fees, writing up assets, wiping out goodwill, adjusting the deferred tax assets / liabilities, adding in new debt, etc.) are almost the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key differences:\n",
      "• In an LBO model you assume that the existing Shareholders' Equity is wiped out and replaced by the equity the private equity firm contributes to buy the company; you may also add in Preferred Stock, Management Rollover, or Rollover from Option Holders to this number as well depending on what you're\n",
      "assuming for transaction financing.\n",
      "• In an LBO model you'll usually be adding a lot more tranches of debt vs. what\n",

      "• In an LBO model you're not combining two companies' Balance Sheets.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Normally we care about the IRR for the equity investors in an LBO - the PE firm that buys the company - but how do we calculate the IRR for the debt investors?\n",
      "Answer: For the debt investors, you need to calculate the interest and principal payments they receive from the company each year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then you simply use the IRR function in Excel and start with the negative amount of the original debt for \"Year 0,\" assume that the interest and principal payments each year are your \"cash flows\" and then assume that the remaining debt balance in the final year is your \"exit value.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the time, returns for debt investors will be lower than returns for the equity investors - but if the deal goes poorly or the PE firm can't sell the company for a good price, the reverse could easily be true.\n",

      "Question:  Why might a private equity firm allot some of a company's new equity in an LBO to a management option pool, and how would this affect the model?\n",
      "Answer: This is done for the same reason you have an Earnout in an M&A deal: the PE firm wants to incentivize the management team and keep everyone on-board until they exit the investment.\n",
      "The difference is that there's no technical limit on how much management might receive from such an option pool: if they hit it out of the park, maybe they'll all become millionaires.\n",
      "\n",
      "In your LBO model, you would need to calculate a per-share purchase price when the PE firm exits the investment, and then calculate how much of the proceeds go to the management team based on the Treasury Stock Method.\n",

      "Question:  Why you would you use PIK (Payment In Kind) debt rather than other types of debt, and how does it affect the debt schedules and the other statements?\n",
      "Answer: Unlike \"normal\" debt, a PIK loan does not require the borrower to make cash interest payments - instead, the interest just accrues to the loan principal, which keeps going up over time. A PIK \"toggle\" allows the company to choose whether to pay the interest in cash or have it accrue to the principal (these have disappeared since the credit crunch).\n",
      "\n",
      "PIK is more risky than other forms of debt and carries with it a higher interest rate than traditional bank debt or high yield debt.\n",

      "Question:  Just like a normal M&A deal, you can structure an LBO either as a stock purchase or as an asset purchase. Can you also use Section 338(h)(10) election?\n",
      "Answer: In most cases, no - because one of the requirements for Section 338(h)(10) is that the buyer must be a C corporation. Most private equity firms are organized as LLCs or Limited Partnerships, and when they acquire companies in an LBO, they create an LLC shell company that \"acquires\" the company on paper.\n",

      "Question:  Walk me through how you calculate optional repayments on debt in an LBO model.\n",
      "Answer: First, note that you only look at optional repayments for Revolvers and Term Loans - high-yield debt doesn't have a prepayment option, so effectively it's always $0.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, you check how much cash flow you have available based on your Beginning Cash Balance, Minimum Cash Balance, Cash Flow Available for Debt Repayment from the Cash Flow Statement, and how much you use to make Mandatory Debt Repayments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, if you've used your Revolver at all you pay off the maximum amount that you can with the cash flow you have available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, for Term Loan A you assume that you pay off the maximum you can, taking into account that you've lost any cash flow you used to pay down the Revolver. You also need to take into account that you might have paid off some of Term Loan A's principal as part of the Mandatory Repayments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, you do the same thing for Term Loan B, subtracting from the \"cash flow available for debt repayment\" what you've already used up on the Revolver and Term Loan A. And just like Term Loan A, you need to take into account any Mandatory Repayments you've made so that you don't pay off more than the entire Term Loan B balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The formulas here get very messy and depend on how your model is set up, but this is the basic idea for optional debt repayments.\n",

      "Question:  Explain how a Revolver is used in an LBO model.\n",
      "Answer: You use a Revolver when the cash required for your Mandatory Debt Repayments exceeds the cash flow you have available to repay them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The formula is: Revolver Borrowing = MAX(0, Total Mandatory Debt Repayment - Cash Flow Available to Repay Debt).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Revolver starts off \"undrawn,\" meaning that you don't actually borrow money and don't accrue a balance unless you need it - similar to how credit cards work.\n",
      "\n",
      "You add any required Revolver Borrowing to your running total for cash flow available for debt repayment before you calculate Mandatory and Optional Debt Repayments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the debt repayments themselves, you assume that any Revolver Borrowing from previous years is paid off first with excess cash flow before you pay off any Term Loans.\n",

      "Question:  How would you adjust the Income Statement in an LBO model?\n",
      "Answer: The most common adjustments:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Cost Savings - Often you assume the PE firm cuts costs by laying off employees, which could affect COGS, Operating Expenses, or both.\n",
      "• New Depreciation Expense - This comes from any PP&E write-ups in the transaction.\n",
      "• New Amortization Expense - This includes both the amortization from written- up intangibles and from capitalized financing fees.\n",
      "• Interest Expense on LBO Debt - You need to include both cash and PIK interest here.\n",
      "• Sponsor Management Fees - Sometimes PE firms charge a \"management fee\" to a company to account for the time and effort they spend managing it.\n",
      "• Common Stock Dividend - Although private companies don't pay dividends to shareholders, they could pay out a dividend recap to the PE investors.\n",
      "• Preferred Stock Dividend - If Preferred Stock is used as a form of financing in the transaction, you need to account for Preferred Stock Dividends on the Income Statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost Savings and new Depreciation / Amortization hit the Operating Income line; Interest Expense and Sponsor Management Fees hit Pre-Tax Income; and you need to subtract the dividend items from your Net Income number.\n",

      "Question:  In an LBO model, is it possible for debt investors to get a higher return than the PE firm? What does it tell us about the company we're modeling?\n",
      "Answer: Yes, and it happens more commonly than you'd think. Remember, high-yield debt investors often get interest rates of 10-15% or more - which effectively guarantees an IRR in that range for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "So no matter what happens to the company or the market, that debt gets repaid and the debt investors get the interest payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's say that the median EBITDA multiples contract, or that the company fails to grow or actually shrinks - in these cases the PE firm could easily get an IRR below what the debt investors get.\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Question:  Most of the time, increased leverage means an increased IRR. Explain how increasing the leverage could reduce the IRR.\n",
      "Answer: This scenario is admittedly rare, but it could happen if the increase leverage increases interest payments or debt repayments to very high levels, preventing the company from using its cash flow for other purposes.\n",
      "Sometimes in LBO models, increasing the leverage increases the IRR up to a certain point - but then after that the IRR starts falling as the interest payments or principal repayments become \"too big.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For this scenario to happen you would need a \"perfect storm\" of:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Relative lack of cash flow / EBITDA growth.\n",
      "2. High interest payments and principal repayments relative to cash flow.\n",
      "3. Relatively high purchase premium or purchase multiple to make it more difficult\n",

      "\n",
      "Regardless of the strategy, diversification is critical because $10 million is a substantial amount for almost anyone. It would be far better to preserve it than to use an aggressive strategy that might result in a big loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the investor is relatively young - in the 25-35 age range - a higher weighting toward equities (maybe 60%) might be appropriate, with the remainder in fixed income. Both portions would be spread across different market segments and geographies.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if the investor is closer to retirement and cares more about income generation and capital preservation, then I would recommend a heavier weighting toward fixed income (maybe 80%).\n",

      "\n",
      "------------------------------\n",
      "Always ask for the investor's goals first. What assets interest them? How long is the investment horizon?\n",
      "\n",
      "CAPITAL GAINS: If the investor is relatively young (20s, 30s), has a longer time horizon, and can tolerate volatility, a well-diversified portfolio with a significant weighting in equities is best.\n",
      "\n",
      "CAPITAL PRESERVATION: As the investor gets older and approaches retirement, the portfolio should shift to fixed income (bonds) rather than equities, and he/she should focus on capital preservation and income rather than capital gains.\n",
