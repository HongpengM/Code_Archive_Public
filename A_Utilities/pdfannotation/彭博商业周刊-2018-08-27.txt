Underline [page 7]: On Aug. 22, the S&P 500 marked the longest bull market in its history, though not yet its largest by percentage gain.

Underline [page 7]: President Trump broke with precedent and criticized the Fed for raising rates (ﬁrst at a Hamptons fundraiser, then publicly on Twitter), sending the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index falling.

Highlight [page 7]: quelled

Highlight [page 7]: PepsiCo agreed to buy SodaStream International for $3.2b ers as consumers shift to low-sugar, DIY drinks.

Underline [page 7]: Microsoft said it uncovered new Russian hacks attempting to inﬂuence U.S. elections, aimed at Republican think tanks that have broken with Trump.

Highlight [page 7]: think tanks

Highlight [page 7]: called off

Underline [page 7]: “I think this puts into high relief the realitylit of this November’s election: It is an up or down vote on Trump’s impeachment. The Democrats have pushed for this, and now they got what they wanted—and if Republicans don’t turn out in force, Trump’s finished.”

Highlight [page 8]: Greece’sOrdealIsFarFromOver

Underline [page 8]: Europe’s leaders are understandably eager to be done with an embarrassing episode.

Underline [page 8]: The debt crisis that began in 2010 highlighted not only Greece’s financial mismanagement but also how Germany, France, and other core countries allowed their banks to enable it. Bailing out Greece was political sleight of hand: It indirectly saved the banks, while putting the onus on the Greek people.

Highlight [page 8]: sleight

Highlight [page 8]: onus

Underline [page 8]: Greece survived.

Highlight [page 8]: But the country is also stuck with the bill: more than €240 billion ($275 billion) in official debt, which, together with private debt, brings Greece’s total burden to more than 180 percent of gross domestic product.

Underline [page 8]: European Union creditors insist the debt is bearable.

Underline [page 8]: This, they estimate, should help the government get the debt down to about 100 percent of GDP by the year 2060.

Underline [page 8]: Unfortunately, the EU’s projections involve extremely wishful thinking

Highlight [page 8]: projections

Underline [page 8]: Greece will have to borrow hundreds of billions of euros

Underline [page 8]: The obvious solution is for the EU to provide Greece with genuine debt relief.

Highlight [page 12]: backlash

Underline [page 12]: In life, business, and now politics, the president of the United States has treated loyalty as a one-sided affair, something he expects from others but has rarely doled out to anyone but his closest family members.

Highlight [page 12]: boutique

Underline [page 12]: As long as he stayed out of legal trouble, Trump also could—and for decades did—tear through people and propositions willy-nilly, dismissing naysayers with a leak to the gossip pages, an appearance on a talk show, or a vicious tweet.

Highlight [page 12]: naysayers

Highlight [page 12]: willy-nilly

Highlight [page 12]: vicious

Underline [page 12]: By the time Trump began running for president in 2015, anyone who’d been paying attention knew exactly what his game amounted to and avoided him.

Highlight [page 12]: collusion

Underline [page 12]: On the same day, Cohen, perhaps the least sophisticated or capable person in a troupe of tragicomically inept advisers and hangers-on, pleaded guilty to tax and bank fraud but with an added twist: He told a courtroom in New York that he made illegal campaign contributions (in the form of hush money paid to paramours) at Trump’s direction.

Underline [page 13]: We now know that Trump rubbed up against felons and felonies during his campaign and transition into the White House, which leaves him surrounded by flagrant wrongdoing and in a perilous legal vise.

Highlight [page 13]: rubbed up against felons

Highlight [page 13]: flagrant

Highlight [page 13]: perilous

Underline [page 13]: As remarkable as Cohen-Manafort Day was, however, we are still only in the early stages of the Mueller investigation. We don’t yet have a full grasp of what Trump knew or did during a career, a campaign, and a presidency that has skirted the limits of the law and may well have leapt beyond them
